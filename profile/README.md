This is a course taught by [Simon Munzert](https://simonmunzert.com/) at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/).

### Course contents

This course will introduce you to the modern data science workflow with R. In recent years, data analysis skills have become essential for those pursuing careers in policy advocacy and evaluation, business consulting and management, or academic research in the fields of education, health, and social science. We will cover topics like version control (Git) and project management; data collection, wrangling, storage, and visualization; model fitting; advanced workflow issues, debugging, automation; and data science ethics. The course is intended for students with some experience in working with R.
